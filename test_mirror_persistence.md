# Mirror Flip Persistence Test

## Test Steps

1. **Initial State Test**
   - Open CueMode with any text file
   - Check if mirrorFlip is disabled by default
   - Verify status indicator shows "Mirror: OFF"

2. **Enable Mirror Flip Test**
   - Press `M` key in webview OR use `Ctrl+Shift+M` (Cmd+Shift+M on Mac)
   - Verify text is horizontally flipped
   - Verify status indicator shows "Mirror: ON"
   - Check VS Code status bar for confirmation message

3. **Configuration Persistence Test**
   - With mirror flip enabled, close webview
   - Restart VS Code completely
   - Open CueMode again with same or different file
   - Verify mirror flip state is preserved (should be ON)
   - Verify text is still horizontally flipped

4. **Disable Mirror Flip Test**
   - Press `M` key again to disable
   - Verify text is back to normal orientation
   - Verify status indicator shows "Mirror: OFF"
   - Close webview and restart VS Code
   - Open CueMode again
   - Verify mirror flip state is preserved (should be OFF)

## Expected Results

- ✅ Mirror flip setting persists across VS Code sessions
- ✅ Configuration loads correctly on webview initialization
- ✅ State synchronization works properly between webview and extension
- ✅ No configuration conflicts observed
- ✅ Status indicator reflects correct state after restart

## Test Status

- [x] Initial state test passed
- [x] Enable mirror flip test passed  
- [x] Configuration persistence test passed
- [x] Disable mirror flip test passed
- [x] Cross-session state preservation verified

## Notes

The mirror flip configuration is stored in VS Code's global settings under `cuemode.mirrorFlip`. The ConfigManager handles loading and saving this setting automatically through VS Code's configuration system.
