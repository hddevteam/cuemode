# CueMode README

This is the README for the Visual Studio Code extension "CueMode". This extension is designed to enhance text readability and focus by providing a unique "Cue Mode" functionality when you are presenting or recording your screen. Just select the text you want to display or just open a text file then click right mouse button and select "Cue Mode" from the context menu. 

## Features

* Increases font size
* Adjusts line height
* Centers the layout
* Changes color scheme for high contrast

* Maximum content width in pixels (default is 800)
* Font size in points (default is 24)
* Line height in ems (default is 1.5)
